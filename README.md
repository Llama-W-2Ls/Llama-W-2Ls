Hi, I'm a solo developer working on educational games,
business software and easy-to-use libraries for Unity and .NET

I've always wanted to build new ideas and see them come to life,
whilst also helping others build their ideas, through my libraries,
feedback or general assistance. (I am a moderator on discussions.unity.com)

You can contact me at my Gmail:
    saifurmohammed25@gmail.com
for any collaboration requests or queries about my projects.
