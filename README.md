Hi, I'm an indie developer working on educational games,
business software and easy-to-use libraries for Unity and .NET

I've always wanted to build new ideas and see them come to life,
whilst also helping others build their ideas, through my libraries,
feedback or general assistance. (I am a moderator at UnityAnswers.com)

I'm currently working on a tower defense simulation game of the human body's
immune system, and how it fights off pathogens, as of April 2021. Hope this is
a great success!

Collabs - let's see.. Anything. Preferably something still relevant, such as my
new open-source Networking project for .NET and Unity. Hoping for someone with any
in-depth knowledge about networking using the TCP protocol, and preferably C# in general.

You can contact me at my Gmail:
    businessmaningtonson@gmail.com
for any collab requests or queries about my projects.

Thanks!
